Portfolio website for RISD Faculty, Christopher Novello. I love this website for it’s unique interface, streamlined design for direct communication, and interesting play on user interaction. Beautifully designed, extremely intuitive, and the details are just delightful.

Sleekest website I’ve ever come across. Beautiful use of minimalism and perfectly brands the company’s image. Easy to navigate, beautiful use of type and color, smooth and intuitive gestures for interaction. <3
